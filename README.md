A script to implement Automated Power Purchase in a dynamic power tarif at Tibber with existing power storage and Shelly Relay.

* Buy your electricity on the power exchange at favorable times and store it temporarily in your electricity storage system.
* Works with the Tibber API and any 2nd gen shelly.
* You can set a self-defined input level so that there is still enough space for your PV electricity.
* In the script, you specify the starting and stopping points for your purchases.
* The current price is asked every 5 minutes.
